## PART 1: Data description 

Growth data come from the Forest Macrosystems Network (FMN) project, belonging to the forests of Niwot Ridge, CO, USA and Barro Colorado Island, Panama; while drought data were downloaded from SPEI Global Drought Monitor.

## PART 2: Scientific goal 

The research question of this project is "Are drought seasons reflected on the growth rates?"

## PART 3: Statistical analysis 

To test if drought seasons are affecting the growth rates, I conducted a Linear Mixed-Effect Model (LME) per site, where SPEI was use as the fixed effect, and a random effect was included for individual trees and years. Then, I used a LME, where SPEI where a fixed effect and the Forest type was an interaction term, with the same random effects.

## PART 4: Results interpretation

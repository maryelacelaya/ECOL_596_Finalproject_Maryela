Summary of "CelayaRosas_final.qmd"
This study explores the relationship between drought intensity and tree growth 
rates in the subalpine forest at Niwot Ridge, CO, USA, using data from the Forest 
Macrosystems Network (FMN) and the SPEI Global Drought Monitor. Growth data were
collected during nine sampling years between 2012 and 2022, while drought intensity
was measured using the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) at 
a three-month resolution, focusing on negative SPEI values indicative of drought.

Key variables analyzed included tree or shrub species, diameter at breast height 
(DBH), and SPEI. The research question, "Are drought seasons reflected in the 
growth rates of trees?" was examined using a Mixed-Effects Model (MEM). This
approach accounted for variability among individual trees (random intercept) and 
tested the effects of drought intensity (SPEI), species, and year as fixed factors.

Preliminary findings revealed that species-specific traits significantly 
influenced growth rates, while drought intensity (SPEI) had no statistically 
significant impact. Log-transformation of growth rate stabilized variance but 
did not fully explain residual variability. The results suggest that tree growth 
variability may be better explained by additional climatic factors 
(e.g., temperature or prolonged drought periods) or non-climatic influences 
(e.g., soil properties or competition). Future research should consider these 
alternative drivers to fully understand the patterns of tree growth under varying
environmental conditions.
